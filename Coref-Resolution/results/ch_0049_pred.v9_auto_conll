But	-
%uh	-
,	-
yeah	-
,	-
it	-
's	-
still	-
a	-
fairly	-
expensive	-
call	-
%uh	-
but	-
it	-
's	-
a	-
lot	-
less	-
expensive	-
if	-
we	-
do	-
it	-
that	-
way	-
than	-
if	-
we	-
actually	-
make	-
my	-
parents	-
in	-
law	-
pay	-
it	-
,	-
then	-
it	-
the	(0)
Dutch	-
have	-
such	-
high	-
taxes	-
on	-
those	-
they	-
consider	-
it	-
a	-
luxury	-
to	-
call	-
around	-
the	(1)
world	-
so	-
they	-
tax	-
it	-
really	-
high	-
.	-
Anyway	-
%um	-
So	-
you	(2)
guys	-
will	-
be	-
in	-
either	-
the	-
eighteenth	-
or	-
the	(3)
nineteenth	-
and	-
you	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
go	-
to	-
%uh	-
Amsterdam	-
.	-
Well	-
I	-
would	-
say	-
is	-
once	-
you	-
're	-
at	-
a	-
hotel	-
uh-huh	-
%um	-
,	-
why	-
do	-
n't	-
you	-
call	-
me	-
at	-
work	-
and	-
let	-
me	-
know	-
where	-
you	-
are	-
,	-
and	-
then	-
we	-
can	-
make	-
arrangements	-
that	-
day	-
%um	-
,	-
that	-
I	-
can	-
meet	-
you	-
in	-
Amsterdam	-
.	-
And	-
maybe	-
I	-
'll	-
come	-
by	-
,	-
public	-
transport	-
.	-
It	-
's	-
probably	-
easier	-
for	-
me	-
to	-
come	-
by	-
public	-
transport	-
in	-
Amsterdam	-
than	-
it	-
is	-
for	-
me	-
to	-
come	-
by	-
car	-
to	-
be	-
honest	-
.	-
mhm	-
.	-
The	-
streets	-
are	-
small	-
and	-
there	-
's	-
no	-
parking	-
.	-
So	-
I	-
probably	-
will	-
come	-
by	-
public	-
transport	-
but	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
know	-
.	-
We	-
'll	-
see	-
where	-
you	-
're	-
staying	-
%um	-
and	-
there	-
's	-
a	-
lot	-
more	-
for	-
you	(4)
guys	-
if	-
you	-
want	-
to	-
see	-
stuff	-
you	-
can	-

I	-
mean	-

here	-
till	-
about	-
ten	-
thirty	-
eleven	-
o'clock	-
mhm	-
.	-
at	-

So	-
if	-
you	-
want	-
we	-
can	-
take	-

%um	-
,	-
depends	-
on	-
what	-
you	(5)
guys	-

So	-
you	(6)

talk	-
with	-
Anya	-
about	-

we	-
think	-
that	-
it	-
would	-
be	-
neat	-
for	-
you	-

So	-
if	-
you	-

'll	-
just	-
put	-
something	-

around	-

can	-
like	-
do	-
a	-
quick	-

,	-
if	-
you	-
want	-
to	-
stay	-
in	-
Amsterdam	-
that	-
's	-
fine	-
.	-
If	-
you	-
want	-
to	-
go	-
%uh	-
off	-
into	-
the	-
countryside	-
somewhere	-
and	-
see	-
a	-
little	-
bit	-
of	-
,	-
echte	-
Holland	-
,	-
real	-
Holland	-
and	-
we	-
can	-
do	-
that	-
too	-
.	-
Actually	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
up	-
to	-
Holland	-
before	-
.	-
Spent	-
about	-
two	-
weeks	-
up	-
there	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
So	-
%um	-
,	-
but	-
that	-
was	-
years	-
and	-
years	-
ago	-
.	-
With	-
your	-
parents	-
when	-
your	-
father	-
was	-
stationed	-
over	-
here	-
,	-
right	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
But	-
we	-
got	-
to	-
see	-
Den	-
Haag	-
and	-
places	-
like	-
that	-
too	-
which	-
we	-
're	-
obviously	-
not	-
going	-
to	-
see	-
this	-
time	-
.	-
But	-
%um	-
has	-
Kim	-
been	-
here	-
before	-
?	-
And	-
,	-
an-	-
No	-
.	-
oh	-
good	-
.	-
But	-
then	-
again	-
I	-
'm	-
not	-
sure	-
that	-
Kim	-
would	-
be	-
interested	-
in	-
seeing	-
Shape	-
Headquarters	-
and	-
you	-
know	-
all	-
that	-
kind	-
of	-
stuff	-
.	-
those	-
military	-
things	-
.	-
Would	-
you	-
be	-
interested	-
in	-
seeing	-
Shape	-
Headquarters	-
again	-
.	-
No	-
.	-
Not	-
really	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
I	-
did	-
n't	-
think	-
so	-
.	-
Somehow	-
I	-
had	-
this	-
feeling	-
that	-
the	-
military	-
taste	-
had	-
been	-
beaten	-
out	-
of	-
you	-
.	-
yep	-
.	-
I	-
'm	-
,	-
the	-
mil-	-
,	-
I	-
ca	-
n't	-
say	-
too	-
bad	-
things	-
about	-
the	-
military	-
though	-
.	-
They	-
still	-
have	-
my	-
goods	-
and	-
they	-
'll	-
probably	-
hold	-
them	-
hostage	-
.	-
And	-
they	-
own	-
my	-
body	-
and	-
soul	-
for	-
like	-
another	-
four	-
years	-
so	-
I	-
just	-
got	-
to	-
pray	-
that	-
they	-
oh	-
do	-
they	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
I	-
owe	-
four	-
years	-
in	-
active	-
reserve	-
time	-
.	-
aw	-
great	-
.	-
Do	-
they	-
do	-
that	-
to	-
everyone	-
?	-
Milo	-
,	-
get	-
out	-
of	-
there	-
yeah	-
--	-
--	-
%eh	-
everyone	-
%uh	-
who	-
has	-
n't	-
been	-
like	-
you	-
were	-
you	-
went	-
through	-
like	-
the	-
thirty	-
six	-
two	-
process	-
.	-
mhm	-
.	-
So	-
you	-
do	-
n't	-
have	-
it	-
but	-
yeah	-
if	-
you	-
just	-
separate	-
normally	-
and	-
you	-
have	-
n't	-
served	-
at	-
least	-
eight	-
years	-
,	-
then	-
you	-
owe	-
it	-
.	-
And	-
that	-
's	-
one	-
of	-
those	-
things	-
they	-
just	-
never	-
tell	-
you	-
up	-
front	-
.	-
No	-
.	-
They	-
never	-
said	-
anything	-
I	-
figured	-
there	-
was	-
something	-
like	-
that	-
because	-
And	-
I	-
was	-
in	-
the	-
inactive	-
reserves	-
the	-
entire	-
time	-
I	-
was	-
in	-
college	-
too	-

So	-
.	-

mean	-
that	-
's	-
the	-
military	-
.	-
I	-
have	-
my	-
discharge	-

yeah	-
I	-
will	-
give	-
a	-
urine	-
sample	-
or	-
a	-
blood	-
sample	-
if	-
they	-
call	-
me	-

for	-
those	-
,	-
but	-
they	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
have	-
to	-
pay	-
my	-
trip	-
back	-
to	-
the	(7)
states	-
.	-
because	-
there	-
's	-
no	-
bases	-
in	-
Holland	-
and	-
I	-
'm	-
not	-
going	-
to	-
pay	-
out	-
of	-
my	-
own	-
expenses	-
to	-
go	-
to	-
Germany	-
or	-
something	-
for	-
them	-
.	-
If	-
they	-
want	-
me	-
they	-
can	-
pay	-
,	-
bring	-
me	-
back	-
active	-
duty	-
and	-
pay	-
me	-
for	-
the	-
day	-
if	-
they	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
drag	-
me	-
off	-
somewhere	-
.	-
But	-
%uh	-
,	-
first	-
they	-
have	-
to	-
find	-
me	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
that	-
's	-
the	-
other	-
it	-
was	-
i-	-
,	-
if	-
you	-
're	-
in	-
another	-
country	-
I	-
mean	-
and	-
you	-
're	-
not	-
planning	-
on	-
coming	-
back	-
to	-
the	-
U	-
S	-
what	-
are	-
they	-
going	-
to	-
do	-
even	-
if	-
you	-
do	-
n't	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
Well	-
I	-
mean	-
I	-
'm	-
still	-
American	-
citizen	-
and	-
I	-
still	-
would	-
like	-
to	-
be	-
welcome	-
in	-
my	-
own	-
country	-
.	-
Although	-
g-	-
%uh	-
I	-
mean	-
if	-
they	-
denied	-
my	-
citizenship	-
and	-
I	-
became	-
a	-
citizen	-
here	-
I	-
probably	-
would	-
n't	-
be	-
a	-
horror	-
either	-
,	-
but	-
%uh	-
yeah	-
right	-
now	-
I	-
mean	-
I	-
do	-
want	-
to	-
keep	-
my	-
American	-
citizenship	-
so	-
.	-
I	-
kind	-
of	-
want	-
to	-
Are	-
you	-
going	-
to	-
become	-
a	-
dual	-
citizen	-
?	-
What	-
's	-
that	-
?	-
Are	-
you	-
going	-
to	-
try	-
and	-
become	-
a	-
dual	-
citizen	-
?	-
Have	-
dual	-
citizenship	-
?	-
You	-
ca	-
n't	-
do	-
that	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
the	-
only	-
way	-
to	-
be	-
a	-
dual	-
citizen	-
is	-
if	-
you	-
're	-
born	-
in	-
a	-
foreign	-
country	-
like	-
if	-
I	-
were	-
born	-
in	-
Holland	-
and	-
then	-
had	-
American	-
parents	-
.	-
Then	-
I	-
could	-
be	-
a	-
dual	-
citizen	-
.	-
But	-
you	-
ca	-
n't	-
If	-
I	-
would	-
to	-
ask	-
to	-
become	-
a	-
citizen	-
in	-
Holland	-
I	-
would	-
automatically	-
lose	-
my	-
American	-
citizenship	-
.	-
As	-
far	-
as	-
the	-
Americans	-
are	-
concerned	-
,	-
yeah	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
The	(8)
Dutch	-
could	-
care	-
less	-
.	-
The	(9)
Dutch	-
would	-
say	-
fine	-
want	-
to	-
be	-
a	-
dual	-
citizen	-
,	-
that	-
's	-
fine	-
,	-
but	-
the	-
Americans	-
as	-
soon	-
as	-
you	-
ask	-
for	-
another	-
citizenship	-
that	-
act	-
of	-
asking	-
for	-
it	-
takes	-
away	-
your	-
American	-
citizenship	-
.	-
I	-
mean	-
it	-
's	-
kind	-
of	-
stupid	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
So	-
I	-
'm	-
an	-
expatriot	-
.	-
An	-
American	-
expatriot	-
.	-
An	-
American	-
living	-
abroad	-
.	-
I	-
still	-
have	-
to	-
file	-
a	-
tax	-
return	-
.	-
Do	-
you	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
But	-
my	-
first	-
seventy	-
five	-
thousand	-
dollars	-
worth	-
of	-
income	-
is	-
tax	-
free	-
.	-
Good	-
grief	-
.	-
As	-
long	-
as	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
bring	-
it	-
back	-
to	-
the	(10)
states	-
.	-
Good	-
grief	-
.	-
I	-
R	-
S	-
for	-
you	-
,	-
%huh	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
oh	-
they	-
want	-
their	-
share	-
.	-
They	-
want	-
their	-
piece	-
of	-
meat	-
.	-
But	-
all	-
foreign	-
taxes	-
are	-
deductible	-
,	-
and	-
my	-
taxes	-
here	-
are	-
fifty	-
percent	-
of	-
income	-
.	-
So	-
the	-
taxes	-
here	-
are	-
so	-
much	-
higher	-
that	-
,	-
yeah	-
I	-
would	-
never	-
have	-
to	-
worry	-
about	-
it	-
.	-
Unless	-
you	-
became	-
C	-
E	-
O	-
of	-
the	-
company	-
then	-
maybe	-
like	-
a	-
thousand	-
dollars	-
would	-
be	-
taxable	-
,	-
right	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
Somehow	-
it	-
raises	-
a	-
small	-
amount	-
.	-
the	-
problem	-
's	-
going	-
to	-

Anya	(11)| (12)
's	-
American	-
salary	-
is	-
taxable	-
here	-
and	-
at	-
fifty	-
percent	-
so	-
we	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
owe	-
some	-
money	-
to	-
the	(13)
Dutch	-
government	-
on	-
her	-
salary	-
.	-
aw	-
.	-
Some	-
amount	-
that	-
has	-
to	-
be	-
deducted	-
a	-
certain	-
amount	-
and	-
the	-
amount	-
we	-
pay	-
the	-
American	-
government	-
is	-
deductible	-
,	-
but	-
we	-
'll	-
still	-
owe	-
some	-
taxes	-
.	-
Th-	-
,	-
see	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-

how	-
it	-
works	-

I	-
have	-
no	-

all	-
works	-

the	-
Quicken	-
Dutch	-
version	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
%ah	-
,	-
you	-
know	-
I	-
would	-
n't	-
trust	-
it	-
because	-
it	-
's	-
so	-
complicated	-
with	-
this	-
international	-
garbage	-
or	-
else	-
the	-
Turbo	-
Tax	-
with	-
the	(14)
Dutch	-
