's	-
good	-
to	-

you	-
here	-

Nice	-
to	-

Lou	-

Let	-
's	-
start	-
with	-
that	-
surprise	-
,	-
the	-
malfeasance	-
that	-
is	-
crossing	-
your	-
desk	-
.	-
Are	-
you	-
suggesting	-
corporate	-
America	-
has	-
not	-
learned	-
its	-
lesson	-
yet	-
?	-
Well	-
,	-
no	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
that	-
quote	-
is	-
a	-
little	-
out	-
of	-
context	-
there	-
.	-
there	-
are	-
15,000	-
companies	-
in	-
the	(0)
United	-
States	-
,	-
and	-
I	-
think	-
the	-
great	-
bulk	-
of	-
them	-
are	-
very	-
honestly	-
managed	-
and	-
so	-
forth	-
.	-
a	-
number	-
of	-
people	-
have	-
had	-
egregious	-
fraud	-
and	-
so	-
forth	-
.	-
There	-
's	-
been	-
a	-
general	-
loosening	-
of	-
morals	-
across	-
the	-
board	-
.	-
What	-
I	-
was	-
referring	-
to	-
in	-
that	-
quote	-
you	-
had	-
was	-
the	-
number	-
of	-
cases	-
we	-
see	-
day	-
in	-
and	-
day	-
out	-
at	-
the	-
lowest	-
levels	-
,	-
scams	-
and	-
so	-
forth	-
,	-
where	-
considerable	-
amounts	-
of	-
money	-
are	-
being	-
made	-
and	-
lost	-
by	-
relatively	-
small	-
investors	-
.	-
Is	-
the	-
investor	-
today	-
in	-
your	-
judgment	-
secure	-
?	-
Well	-
,	-
I	-
think	-
that	-
the	-
marketplace	-
is	-
becoming	-
increasingly	-
secure	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
a	-
number	-
of	-
the	-
reforms	-
that	-
have	-
come	-
via	-
the	(1)
Sarbanes	-
-	-
Oxley	-
Act	-
and	-
a	-
number	-
of	-
things	-
that	-
we	-
have	-
done	-
at	-
the	-
SEC	-
are	-
basically	-
making	-
everybody	-
take	-
a	-
new	-
look	-
at	-
how	-
they	-
're	-
performing	-
their	-
duty	-
as	-
a	-
director	-
,	-
how	-
they	-
're	-
performing	-
their	-
duties	-
on	-
audit	-
committees	-
and	-
compensation	-
committees	-
and	-
in	-
Wall	-
Street	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
the	-
reforms	-
that	-
came	-
as	-
a	-
part	-
of	-
the	-
large	-
settlement	-
are	-
going	-
to	-
change	-
the	-
way	-
research	-
and	-
investment	-
banking	-
are	-
done	-
to	-
the	-
betterment	-
of	-
the	-
individual	-
investor	-
.	-
And	-
some	-
people	-
are	-
surprised	-
and	-
I	-
might	-
even	-
add	-
pleased	-
in	-
this	-
city	-
that	-
your	-
SEC	-
has	-
been	-
quick	-
to	-
react	-
when	-
Phil	-
Purcell	-
of	-
Morgan	-
Stanley	-
made	-
a	-
statement	-
that	-
your	-
SEC	-
did	-
n't	-
think	-
and	-
that	-
you	-
did	-
n't	-
think	-
expressed	-
appropriate	-
contrition	-
when	-
Bear	-
Stearns	-
stepped	-
out	-
of	-
line	-
in	-
the	(2)| (3)
view	-
of	-
the	-
SEC	-
.	-
It	-
was	-
n't	-
a	-
polite	-
phone	-
call	-
quietly	-
made	-
,	-
either	-
from	-
your	-
enforcement	-
division	-
or	-
from	-
your	-
office	-
,	-
it	-
was	-
rather	-
public	-
.	-
Is	-
that	-
the	-
way	-
you	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
operate	-
?	-
Well	-
,	-
Lou	-
,	-
we	-
're	-
deadly	-
serious	-
about	-
bringing	-
reform	-
into	-
the	-
marketplace	-
.	-
We	-
're	-
deadly	-
serious	-
about	-
some	-
of	-
the	-
actions	-
we	-
've	-
taken	-
,	-
and	-
when	-
we	-
see	-
people	-
who	-
do	-
n't	-
appear	-
to	-
be	-
taking	-
it	-
too	-
seriously	-
,	-
we	-
're	-
going	-
to	-
get	-
to	-
them	-
right	-
away	-
.	-
And	-
I	-
think	-
perhaps	-
no	-
one	-
more	-
surprised	-
than	-
some	-
of	-
the	-
people	-
running	-
those	-
firms	-
on	-
Wall	-
Street	-
.	-
You	-
have	-
also	-
expressed	-
concern	-
about	-
excessive	-
executive	-
compensation	-
,	-
particularly	-
CEO	-
compensation	-
.	-
Is	-
there	-
really	-
anything	-
that	-
can	-
be	-
done	-
about	-
this	-
problem	-
?	-
I	-
think	-
so	-
,	-
Lou	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
the	-
real	-
next	-
step	-
here	-
is	-
for	-
compensation	-
committees	-
to	-
spend	-
a	-
little	-
more	-
time	-
than	-
they	-
do	-
on	-
what	-
they	-
're	-
really	-
compensating	-
for	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
there	-
's	-
been	-
too	-
much	-
emphasis	-
on	-
performance	-
defined	-
strictly	-
by	-
stock	-
performance	-
and	-
earnings	-
per	-
share	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
there	-
are	-
a	-
number	-
of	-
other	-
measures	-
that	-
indicate	-
how	-
well	-
somebody	-
's	-
doing	-
running	-
a	-
company	-
,	-
and	-
I	-
think	-
corporation	-
boards	-
need	-
to	-
spend	-
more	-
time	-
on	-
that	-
dimension	-
.	-
And	-
with	-
you	-
as	-
Chairman	-
of	-
the	-
SEC	-
exercising	-
your	-
bully	-
pulpit	-
,	-
one	-
assumes	-
