What	-
we	-
know	-
about	-
Saddam	-
Hussein	-
in	-
recent	-
years	-
is	-
that	-
he	-
had	-
changed	-
a	-
lot	-
.	-
He	-
had	-
Islamic	-
tendecies	-
and	-
acts	-
which	-
many	-
Iraqis	-
mentioned	-
,	-
saying	-
that	-
Saddam	-
supported	-
to	-
a	-
great	-
extent	-
the	-
building	-
of	-
mosques	-
centers	-
for	-
memorizing	-
Koran	-
,	-
and	-
charities	-
,	-
and	-
the	(2)| (3)
dancer	-
's	-
punishment	-
was	-
death	-
.	-
He	-
had	-
many	-
works	-
.	-
But	-
some	-
explained	-
his	-
Islamic	-
tendency	-
by	-
saying	-
that	-
he	-
was	-
currying	-
favor	-
with	-
the	-
Sunnis	-
as	-
if	-
they	-
were	-
reading	-
his	-
mind	-
.	-
I	-
have	-
followed	-
Saddam	-
Hussein	-
,	-
especially	-
in	-
recent	-
years	-
,	-
and	-
I	-
noticed	-
about	-
him	-
was	-
that	-
there	-
was	-
religion	-
but	-
there	-
was	-
injustice	-
and	-
coarseness	-
.	-
And	-
his	-
punishment	-
was	-
unjust	-
.	-
I	-
mean	-
,	-
for	-
example	-
,	-
the	-
dancer	-
would	-
be	-
killed	-
after	-
second	-
offence	-
.	-
I	-
did	-
not	-
expect	-
anyone	-
to	-
kill	-
the	-
dancer	-
unless	-
good	-
would	-
come	-
of	-
it	-
,	-
but	-
like	-
the	-
most	-
idiots	-
his	-
aim	-
was	-
correct	-
but	-
the	-
method	-
was	-
wrong	-
.	-
Another	-
example	-
-	-
after	-
his	-
son	-
Udai	-
harmed	-
the	-
Iraqi	-
people	-
and	-
attacked	-
women	-
and	-
other	-
matters	-
,	-
Saddam	-
ordered	-
him	-
to	-
be	-
killed	-
.	-
And	-
in	-
fact	-
he	-
was	-
fired	-
on	-
but	-
survived	-
miraculously	-
,	-
after	-
being	-
hit	-
with	-
several	-
fatal	-
shots	-
some	-
of	-
which	-
hit	-
his	-
spine	-
.	-
This	-
is	-
a	-
sign	-
that	-
there	-
was	-
good	-
in	-
him	-
otherwise	-
he	-
would	-
not	-
have	-
ordered	-
the	(4)
killing	-
of	-
his	-
son	-
,	-
his	-
own	-
child	-
.	-
But	-
he	-
was	-
not	-
a	-
scholar	-
nor	-
feared	-
in	-
God	-
.	-
I	-
myself	-
heard	-
from	-
some	-
people	-
who	-
were	-
in	-
Iraq	-
about	-
the	-
things	-
that	-
Saddam	-
Hussein	-
used	-
to	-
do	-
,	-
and	-
could	-
not	-
be	-
reasonably	-
done	-
by	-
anyone	-
other	-
than	-
a	-
good	-
Moslem	-
To	-
the	-
extent	-
that	-
many	-
said	-
of	-
his	-
actions	-
that	-
they	-
were	-
only	-
to	-
gain	-
favor	-
amongst	-
the	(5)
Sunnis	-
and	-
the	-
religious	-
.	-
But	-
we	-
judge	-
by	-
the	-
appearances	-
and	-
his	-
end	-
was	-
in	-
line	-
with	-
the	-
appearance	-
.	-
In	-
his	-
last	-
days	-
during	-
the	-
fall	-
of	-
Baghdad	-
and	-
his	-
disappearance	-
,	-
an	-
old	-
woman	-
or	-
man	-
said	-
on	-
TV	-
on	-
al	(6)
-	-
Jazeera	-
channel	-
that	-
he	-
was	-
hiding	-
in	-
her	-
house	-
and	-
had	-
had	-
his	-
prayer	-
mat	-
with	-
him	-
and	-
was	-
always	-
praying	-
and	-
reading	-
the	-
Koran	-
.	-
Do	-
we	-
say	-
no	-
,	-
this	-
is	-
hypocrisy	-
?	-
Bear	-
in	-
mind	-
that	-
many	-
have	-
said	-
that	-
Saddam	-
prayed	-
regularly	-
especially	-
after	-
he	-
was	-
put	-
in	-
prison	-
by	-
the	-
Rafida	-
and	-
their	-
masters	-
.	-
Some	-
of	-
those	-
who	-
said	-
that	-
he	-
was	-
always	-
praying	-
and	-
reading	-
the	-
Koran	-
are	-
the	-
Christians	-
who	-
visited	-
him	-
in	-
his	-
prison	-
cell	-
.	-
Finally	-
,	-
during	-
his	-
hanging	-
,	-
the	-
Rafida	-
tried	-
to	-
distract	-
him	-
and	-
keep	-
him	-
from	-
saying	-
the	-
Creed	-
before	-
his	-
death	-
.	-
They	-
were	-
trying	-
everything	(7)
they	-
could	-
but	-
we	-
say	-
that	-
God	-
made	-
him	-
steadfast	-
for	-
the	(8)
whole	-
world	-
to	-
see	-
that	-
he	-
died	-
acknowledging	-
God	-
.	-
The	-
Rafida	-
were	-
shouting	-
provocative	-
words	-
such	-
as	-
Muqtada	(9)
and	-
al	-
-	-
Sadr	-
so	-
that	-
he	-
would	-
lose	-
control	-
and	-
curse	-
them	-
,	-
then	-
they	-
would	-
have	-
killed	-
him	-
.	-
So	-
they	-
could	-
show	-
the	-
clip	-
in	-
which	-
there	-
is	-
cursing	-
and	-
insults	-
from	-
Saddam	-
and	-
cut	-
the	-
rest	-
.	-
However	-
he	-
remained	-
steadfast	-
in	-
saying	-
the	-
creed	-
and	-
was	-
killed	-
whilst	-
saying	-
it	-
.	-
I	-
believe	-
that	-
this	-
could	-
n't	-
have	-
happened	-
without	-
God	-
making	-
him	-
steadfast	-
otherwise	-
God	-
would	-
not	-
have	-
made	-
him	-
steadfast	-
in	-
it	-
.	-
As	-
one	-
of	-
the	-
sheikhs	-
says	-
,	-
many	-
people	-
when	-
they	-
were	-
supposed	-
to	-
say	-
the	-
creed	-
and	-
were	-
being	-
dictated	-
the	-
creed	-
by	-
those	-
present	-
would	-
murmur	-
"	-
Did	-
love	-
see	-
drunkards	-
?	-
"	-
Other	-
people	-
say	-
,	-
I	-
have	-
not	-
said	-
it	-
while	-
I	-
was	-
alive	-
and	-
you	-
want	-
me	-
to	-
say	-
it	-
when	-
I	-
am	-
dying	-
...	-
the	-
truth	-
is	-
what	-
is	-
apparent	-
.	-
But	-
Saddam	-
Hussein	-
was	-
reasonable	-
in	-
that	-
he	-
repented	-
and	-
turned	-
to	-
his	-
creator	-
who	-
receives	-
the	-
repentance	-
from	-
his	-
slave	-
.	-
And	-
he	-
committed	-
himself	-
to	-
the	-
worship	-
of	-
God	-
.	-
And	-
remained	-
loyal	-
to	-
God	-
.	-
I	-
ask	-
God	-
to	-
have	-
mercy	-
on	-
him	-
and	-
to	-
forgive	-
him	-
and	-
to	-
give	-
him	-
an	-
ample	-
dwelling	-
in	-
his	-
paradise	-
and	-
guide	-

rest	-
of	-
