Getting	-
both	-
to	-
attend	-
was	-
not	-
an	-
easy	-
task	-

The	-
last	-
thing	-
President	-
Clinton	-
did	-
today	-
before	-
heading	-
to	-
the	-
Mideast	-
is	-
go	-
to	-
church	-

appropriate	-
,	-
perhaps	-
,	-
given	-
the	-
enormity	-
of	-
the	-
task	-
he	-
and	-
his	-
national	-
security	-
team	-
face	-
in	-
the	-
days	-
ahead	-
.	-
We	-
do	-
have	-
to	-
try	-
to	-
reduce	-
the	-
violee	-
and	-
take	-
a	-
turn	-
back	-
for	-
a	-
period	-
of	-
calmness	-
so	-
that	-
we	-
can	-
move	-
back	-
to	-
a	-
peace	-
process	-
,	-
but	-
even	-
if	-
the	-
violence	-
subsides	-
,	-
Israelis	-
and	-
Palestinians	-
will	-
still	-
have	-
to	-
deal	-
with	-
an	-
open	-
wound	-
--	-
a	-
scar	-
so	-
long	-
and	-
so	-
deep	-
from	-
these	-
last	-
two	-
weeks	-
,	-
it	-
may	-
be	-
years	-
before	-
there	-
is	-
a	-
real	-
effort	-
at	-
talking	-
peace	-
again	-
.	-
Both	-
sides	-
have	-
almost	-
stepped	-
back	-
six	-
years	-
in	-
terms	-
of	-
their	-
statements	-
and	-
attitudes	-
,	-
six	-
years	-
or	-
more	-
--	-
before	-
the	-
Oslo	-
accords	-
,	-
when	-
the	-
Israelis	-
promised	-
land	-
and	-
the	-
Palestinians	-
promised	-
security	-
.	-
Today	-
there	-
is	-
only	-
finger	-
pointing	-
.	-
Arafat	-
deliberately	-
launched	-
it	-
in	-
order	-
to	-
attract	-
the	(3)
attention	-
of	-
the	(4)
world	-
by	-
paying	-
with	-
the	-
blood	-
of	-
his	-
own	-
people	-
.	-
I	-
urge	-
Mr.	-
Barak	-
to	-
lift	-
the	(5)
siege	-
of	-
Palestinians	-
,	-
to	-
speak	-
to	-
the	-
Palestinians	-
as	-
its	-
neighbors	-
because	-
they	-
are	-
his	-
neighbors	-
.	-
The	-
Palestinians	-
clearly	-
face	-
the	-
greatest	-
pressure	-
in	-
this	-
summit	-
,	-
since	-
the	-
Israelis	-
are	-
not	-
the	-
only	-
ones	-
blaming	-
them	-
for	-
the	-
outbreak	-
of	-
violence	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
we	-
all	-
know	-
that	-
Arafat	-
is	-
in	-
charge	-
of	-
the	-
Palestinian	-
Authority	-
.	-
He	-
has	-
the	-
responsibility	-
for	-
controlling	-
the	-
violence	-
.	-
But	-
it	-
may	-
not	-
be	-
so	-
easy	-
for	-
Arafat	-
.	-
Today	-
,	-
thousands	-
of	-
Palestinians	-
are	-
calling	-
for	-
continued	-
fighting	-
.	-
Half	-
of	-
the	-
Palestinian	-
population	-
is	-
under	-
the	-
age	-
of	-
14	-
and	-
many	-
have	-
been	-
influenced	-
by	-
military	-
factions	-
like	-
Hamas	-
and	-
Hezbollah	-
--	-
not	-
by	-
Arafat	-
.	-
When	-
you	-
talk	-
about	-
Arafat	-
and	-
the	-
people	-
around	-
him	-
,	-
you	-
have	-
to	-
understand	-
how	-
young	-
this	-
population	-
really	-
is	-
--	-
how	-
volatile	-
,	-
how	-
close	-
to	-
exploding	-
it	-
really	-
is	-

Almost	-
no	-
one	-
seems	-
optimistic	-
about	-
the	-
future	-
of	-
the	-
Mideast	-

Whenever	-
you	-
