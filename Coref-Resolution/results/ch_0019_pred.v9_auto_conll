So	-
,	-
anyway	-
,	-
how	-
are	-
you	-
doing	-
these	-
days	-
?	-
Things	-
are	-
going	-
very	-
well	-
.	-
I	-
think	-
I	-
had	-
mentioned	-
before	-
%uh	-
,	-
that	-
there	-
's	-
a	-
company	-
now	-
that	-
I	-
'm	-
working	-
with	-
%um	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
which	-
is	-
very	-
much	-
just	-
myself	-
and	-
Guss	-
.	-
oh	-
.	-
And	-
that	-
%um	-
No	-
,	-
you	-
had	-
n't	-
mentioned	-
that	-
.	-
%eh	-
,	-
oh	-
,	-
okay	-
.	-
okay	-
,	-
so	-
%um	-
%eh	-
you	-
told	-
me	-
that	-
you	-
were	-
leaving	-
the	-
company	-
that	-
you	-
were	-
at	-
,	-
and	-
you	-
were	-
entertaining	-
offers	-
.	-
And	-
,	-
%uh	-
well	-
it	-
seemed	-
to	-
make	-
sense	-
since	-
I	-
had	-
a	-
client	-
to	-
just	-
kind	-
of	-
set	-
up	-
my	-
own	-
company	-
,	-
of	-
sorts	-
.	-
%um	-
oh	-
.	-
So	-
things	-
are	-
going	-
extremely	-
well	-
.	-
So	-
,	-
I	-
had	-
one	-
client	-
who	-
said	-
that	-
he	-
'd	-
pay	-
me	-
a	-
minimum	-
amount	-
.	-
You	-
know	-
,	-
he	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
there	-
would	-
be	-
a	-
minimum	-
amount	-
of	-
work	-
,	-
of	-
about	-
%uh	-
,	-
a	-
day	-
a	-
week	-
for	-
the	-
next	-
two	-
three	-
years	-
.	-
mhm	-
.	-
Which	-
is	-
sufficient	-
to	-
pay	-
all	-
my	-
bills	-
then	-
so	-
I	-
decided	-
that	-
it	-
would	-
make	-
sense	-
to	-
do	-
this	-
.	-
%um	-
and	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
getting	-
substantially	-
more	-
work	-
than	-
then	-
.	-
%mm	-
.	-
So	-
I	-
'm	-
quite	-
pleased	-
.	-
Well	-
that	-
's	-
good	-
.	-
%um	-
,	-
so	-
I	-
have	-
a	-
bunch	-
of	-
%uh	-
work	-
that	-
I	-
need	-
to	-
do	-
on	-
my	-
flat	-
this	-
year	-
.	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
telling	-
you	-
that	-
I	-
needed	-
to	-
do	-
that	-
roof	-
atrium	-
for	-
quite	-
some	-
time	-
.	-
But	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
it	-
should	-
come	-
out	-
this	-
year	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
well	-
that	-
's	-
good	-
.	-
It	-
should	-
be	-
done	-
in	-
a	-
few	-
months	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
yeah	-
I	-
remember	-
So	-
you	-
talking	-
a	-
little	-
bit	-
about	-
it	-
at	-
one	-
point	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
yeah	-
.	-
So	-
you	-
have	-
no	-
intentions	-
of	-
coming	-
over	-
this	-
way	-
any	-
time	-
soon	-
?	-
%um	-
.	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
see	-
the	-
finances	-
occurring	-
uh-huh	-
,	-
right	-
.	-
for	-
a	-
while	-
.	-
%um	-
,	-
actually	-
right	-
at	-
the	-
moment	-
finances	-
are	-
not	-
going	-
real	-
well	-
.	-
But	-
%ah	-
well	-
.	-
I	-
am	-
working	-
on	-
that	-
one	-
.	-
%uh	-
.	-
It	-
's	-
just	-
But	-
%um	-
%uh	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
the	-
main	-
reason	-
for	-
that	-
is	-
I	-
had	-
not	-
really	-
anticipated	-
a	-
few	-
expenses	-
that	-
recently	-
came	-
up	-
%ah	-
.	-
%uh	-
,	-
related	-
to	-
a	-
couple	-
of	-
burglaries	-
that	-
I	-
had	-

oh	-
,	-
harsh	-
.	-
Harsh	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
and	-
.	-
Not	-
a	-

I	-
can	-
do	-
about	-
that	-
now	-

Indeed	-
.	-
Indeed	-

have	-

And	-
So	-
that	-
's	-
what	-
I	-
'm	-
doing	-
.	-
Sounds	-
good	-
.	-
But	-
%um	-
Anyway	-
,	-
%uh	-
One	-
of	-
the	-
main	-
reasons	-
that	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
such	-

%uh	-

has	-

I	-
've	-
actually	-
been	-
doing	-
a	-
lot	-
of	-
it	-
.	-
oh	-
wow	-
.	-
And	-
%uh	-
,	-
I	-
turned	-
in	-
my	(0)| (1)
Master	-
's	-
thesis	-
back	-
in	-
May	-
,	-
and	-
I	-
'm	-
actually	-
presently	-
working	-
on	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
several	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
articles	-
oh	-
,	-
okay	-
.	-
Impressive	-
.	-
from	-
it	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
actually	-
it	-
turns	-
out	-
that	-
one	-
thing	-
,	-
one	-
little	-
bit	-
in	-
what	-
I	-
was	-
doing	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
is	-
going	-
to	-
turn	-
out	-
to	-
be	-
very	-
important	-
in	-
the	(2)
end	-
.	-
%uh	-
,	-
from	-
what	-
I	-
had	-
been	-
reading	-
in	-
the	-
literature	-
.	-
You	-
see	-
the	-
one	-
very	-
annoying	-
thing	-
about	-
all	-
of	-
this	-
,	-
was	-
my	-
advisor	-
has	-
been	-
in	-
France	-
for	-
a	-
year	-
and	-
a	-
half	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
And	-
this	-
made	-
writing	-
my	-
thesis	-
very	-
annoying	-
because	-
you	-
know	-
there	-
was	-
n't	-
much	-
discussion	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
yup	-
,	-
yup	-
.	-
But	-
,	-
%um	-
Anyway	-
,	-
I	-
had	-
been	-
kind	-
of	-
telling	-
him	-
that	-
,	-
you	-
know	-
,	-
from	-
my	-
reading	-
of	-
the	-
literature	-
,	-
I	-
thought	-
that	-
this	-
one	-
little	-
alteration	-
I	-
had	-
made	-
in	-
my	-
model	-
was	-
kind	-
of	-
clever	-
and	-
unique	-
.	-
mhm	-
.	-
And	-
it	-
made	-
the	-
one	-
type	-
of	-
solution	-
occur	-
,	-
which	-
was	-
seen	-
experimentally	-
,	-
but	-
none	-
of	-
the	-
other	-
models	-
%uh	-
,	-
had	-
?	-
Yes	-
.	-
the-	-
,	-
I	-
'm	-
looking	-
at	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
multi	-
mode	-
lasers	-
.	-
And	-
one	-
of	-
the	-
things	-
that	-
they	-
find	-
experimentally	-
are	-
what	-
they	-
call	-
anti	-
phased	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
states	-
,	-
where	-
if	-
you	-
look	-
at	-
the	-
total	-
intensity	-
uh-huh	-
.	-
of	-
the	-
laser	-
,	-
you	-
get	-
an	-
oscillation	-
which	-
is	-
characterized	-
by	-
one	-
frequency	-
.	-
Yes	-
.	-
okay	-
.	-
if	-
you	-
separate	-
out	-
the	-
different	-
modes	-
of	-
the	-
laser	-
mhm	-
.	-
and	-
look	-
at	-
one	-
of	-
those	-
,	-
you	-
get	-
more	-
than	-
one	-
frequency	-
.	-
okay	-
.	-
So	-
what	-
's	-
happening	-
is	-
that	-
the	-
modes	-
are	-
oscillating	-
out	-
of	-
phase	-
so	-
that	-
they	-
completely	-
mask	-
each	-
other	-
's	-
Exactly	-
.	-
%hm	-
.	-
oscillations	-
on	-
these	-
other	-
frequencies	-
.	-
And	-
%uh	-
With	-
a	-
pretty	-
simple	-
model	-
you	-
can	-
find	-
that	-
frequency	-
in	-
a	-
transient	-
,	-
but	-
you	-
ca	-
n't	-
find	-
that	-
frequency	-
in	-
a	-
driven	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
frequency	-
.	-
You	-
ca	-
n't	-
find	-
so	-
that	-
it	-
will	-
sustain	-
.	-
okay	-
.	-
Yes	-
.	-
So	-
yeah	-
,	-
that	-
particular	-
frequency	-
according	-
to	-
most	-
models	-
damps	-
out	-
very	-
quickly	-
.	-
And	-
so	-
you	-
should	-
n't	-
actually	-
really	-
be	-
able	-
to	-
ever	-
see	-
it	-
.	-
%hm	-
.	-
The	-
only	-
thing	-
is	-
,	-
that	-
,	-
when	-
you	-
do	-
the	-
experiment	-
you	-
see	-
it	-
.	-
Got	-
it	-
,	-
got	-
it	-
.	-
I	-
see	-
.	-
So	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
I	-
found	-
a	-
simple	-
modification	-
of	-
the	-
original	-
formula	-
,	-
which	-
unfortunately	-
makes	-
the	-
solutions	-
horrendously	-
nasty	-
.	-
And	-
in	-
most	-
cases	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
insoluble	-
.	-
But	-
yeah	-
.	-
it	-
gives	-
a	-
driving	-
term	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
okay	-
.	-
So	-
,	-
it	-
actually	-
creates	-
a	-
situation	-
where	-
you	-
get	-
the	-
right	-
sort	-
of	-
answer	-
,	-
you	-
just	-
ca	-
n't	-
always	-
write	-
it	-
down	-
very	-
easily	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
oh	-
wow	-
.	-
so	-
you	-
're	-
pushing	-
forward	-
the	(3)
bounds	-
of	-
theoretical	-
laser	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
whatever	-
it	-
is	-
science	-
.	-
But	-
which	-
,	-
%um	-
,	-
is	-
kind	-
of	-
interesting	-
considering	-
that	-
that	-
's	-
not	-
really	-
my	-
thing	-
.	-
.	-
Indeed	-
.	-
Indeed	-
.	-
being	-
an	-
experimentalist	-
,	-
not	-
a	-
theorist	-
.	-
%um	-
Indeed	-
.	-
oh	-
wow	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
impressive	-
.	-
But	-
so	-
are	-
you	-
going	-
to	-
get	-
an	-
article	-
in	-
Nature	-
or	-
something	-
?	-
%um	-
,	-
actually	-
,	-
I	-
'm	-
not	-
sure	-
if	-
we	-
're	-
shooting	-
for	-
op-	-
,	-
I	-
think	-
Optics	-
Letters	-
is	-
probably	-
the	-
one	-
that	-
we	-
're	-
shooting	-
for	-
,	-
or	-
else	-
,	-
perhaps	-
,	-
though	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
think	-
it	-
's	-
quite	-
that	-
significant	-
,	-
would	-
be	-
Phys	-
Rev	-
Letters	-
.	-
%hm	-
.	-
But	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
we	-
want	-
to	-
write	-
a	-
letter	-
,	-
and	-
then	-
a	-
couple	-
articles	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
%hm	-
.	-
impressive	-
.	-
And	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
know	-
how	-
much	-
you	-
know	-
about	-
scientific	-
literature	-
,	-
but	-
letters	-
are	-
much	-
more	-
prestigious	-
than	-
,	-
articles	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
okay	-
.	-
oh	-
,	-
I	-
did	-
n't	-
realize	-
that	-
.	-
okay	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
so	-
that	-
's	-
why	-
it	-
's	-
actually	-
a	-
big	-
deal	-
is	-
I	-
mean	-
,	-
you	-
know	-
,	-
writing	-
a	-
couple	-
of	-
articles	-
based	-
on	-
your	(4)| (5)
Master	-
's	-

,	-

,	-
not	-
at	-
all	-
unusual	-
in	-
Physics	-
and	-
yeah	-
.	-
%uh	-
,	-
it	-
's	-
the	-
fact	-
that	-
I	-
would	-
be	-
writing	-
a	-
letter	-
that	-
is	-
the	-
impressive	-
part	-
of	-
it	-
all	-

And	-
what	-
's	-
actually	-
kind	-
of	-
interesting	-
is	-
I	-
kept	-
telling	-
Neil	-
that	-
I	-
thought	-
that	-
this	-
was	-
kind	-
of	-
significant	-
.	-
And	-
Neil	-
kept	-
writing	-
back	-
that	-
I	-
should	-
tone	-
this	-
part	-
of	-
the	-
thesis	-
down	-
that	-
You	-
know	-
,	-
people	-
see	-
the	-
anti	-
phased	-
motion	-
,	-
and	-
it	-
's	-
true	-
they	-
do	-
in	-
the	-
transients	-
And	-
I	-
was	-
having	-
a	-
lot	-
of	-
trouble	-
getting	-
across	-
to	-
him	-
that	-
all	-
of	-
the	-
literature	-
has	-
this	-
frequency	-
in	-
the	-
transients	-
Yes	-
.	-
%eh	-
and	-
not	-
driven	-
.	-
And	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
what	-
happened	-
was	-
after	-
I	-
had	-
turned	-
in	-
my	-
thesis	-
but	-
before	-
I	-
saw	-
Neil	-
again	-
,	-
he	-
went	-
to	-
a	-
conference	-
in	-
Rochester	-
and	-
there	-
this	-
was	-
a	-
big	-
issue	-
among	-
the	-
people	-
who	-
were	-
doing	-
this	-
work	-
,	-
was	-
,	-
that	-
their	-
models	-
could	-
n't	-
show	-
this	-
as	-
a	-
driven	-
frequency	-
,	-
yet	-
their	-
experiments	-
showed	-
it	-
as	-
a	-
driven	-
frequency	-
.	-
oh	-
cool	-
.	-
and	-
so	-
Neil	-
then	-
--	-
Said	-
oh	-
just	-
a	-
second	-
I	-
--	-
like	-
a	-
week	-
later	-
came	-
to	-
Bryn	-
Mawr	-
and	-
he	-
said	-
,	-
hey	-
Lowell	-
,	-
we	-
got	-
to	-
write	-
this	-
up	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
And	-
I	-
was	-
like	-
,	-
well	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
telling	-
you	-
that	-
Neil	-
.	-
Indeed	-
.	-
So	-
Cool	-
.	-
Cool	-
.	-
that	-
's	-
mostly	-
the	-
sort	-
of	-
stuff	-
that	-
I	-
'm	-
spending	-
a	-
lot	-
of	-
time	-
on	-
now	-
.	-
%um	-
Well	-
it	-
'll	-
look	-
good	-
on	-
your	-
C	-
V	-
,	-
your	-
resume	-
.	-
so	-
you	-
might	-
as	-
well	-
spend	-
the	-
time	-
.	-
Yes	-
,	-
well	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
no	-
,	-
it	-
's	-
definitely	-
worth	-
doing	-
.	-
%um	-
,	-
and	-
I	-
would	-
have	-
been	-
spending	-
more	-
time	-
on	-
it	-
if	-
it	-
were	-
n't	-
for	-
%uh	-
dealing	-
with	-
the	-
burglary	-
issues	-
oh	-
yeah	-
but	-
that	-
I	-
've	-
been	-
dealing	-
with	-

So	-
are	-
you	-
still	-
living	-
in	-

house	-
in	-
the	(6)| (7)

of	-
the	(8)

.	-
Yes	-
.	-
yeah	-
,	-
okay	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
I	-
mean	-
the	-
thing	-
that	-
i-	-
this	-
place	-
is	-
incredibly	-
easy	-
to	-
break	-
into	-
if	-
you	-

It	-
's	-
not	-
a	-

of	-
whether	-
or	-
not	-
,	-
%uh	-
you	-
know	-
,	-
that	-
was	-
easy	-
,	-
it	-
was	-
just	-
that	-
no	-
one	-
really	-
knew	-
it	-
was	-
worth	-
breaking	-
into	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
And	-
so	-
the	-
problem	-
is	-
that	-
now	-
they	-
found	-
out	-
that	-
it	-
's	-
worth	-
breaking	-
into	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
And	-
unfortunately	-
.	-
Well	-
,	-
it	-
's	-
kind	-
of	-
odd	-
.	-
They	-
've	-
stolen	-
very	-
weird	-
things	-
for	-
the	-
most	-
part	-
.	-
%hm	-
.	-
as	-
far	-
yeah	-
as	-
a	-
.	-
The	-
first	-
time	-
they	-
broke	-
in	-
,	-
what	-
they	-
stole	-
was	-
just	-
bizarre	-
,	-
mostly	-
worthless	-
stuff	-
.	-
And	-
,	-
%uh	-
%huh	-
the	-
most	-
worthwhile	-
thing	-
as	-
far	-
as	-
monetary	-
value	-
went	-
that	-
they	-
stole	-
was	-
the	-
pre-amplifier	-
of	-
my	-
stereo	-
.	-
Unfortunately	-
,	-
because	-
it	-
's	-
a	-
nice	-
pre-amplifier	-
,	-
it	-
has	-
an	-
off	-
board	-
power	-
supply	-
which	-
they	-
did	-
n't	-
steal	-
,	-
which	-
makes	-
the	-
thing	-
that	-
they	-
**stoled**	-
absolutely	-
worthless	-
.	-
%huh	-
.	-
So	-
.	-
That	-
's	-
bizarre	-
.	-
Bizarre	-
.	-
so	-
when	-
they	-
broke	-
in	-
the	-
second	-
time	-
did	-
they	-
steal	-
the	-
%uh	-
offboard	-
amplifier	-
?	-
Actually	-
,	-
no	-
,	-
all	-
they	-
stole	-
the	-
second	-
time	-
was	-
my	-
bike	-
.	-
%huh	-
.	-
Which	-
was	-
actually	-
where	-
the	-
major	-
problem	-
came	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
Is	-
that	-
I	-
suddenly	-
had	-
no	-
transportation	-
.	-
And	-
so	-
,	-
I	-
then	-
had	-
to	-
go	-
bike	-
hunting	-
and	-
eventually	-
get	-
another	-
bike	-
,	-
and	-
%mm	-
.	-
that	-
cost	-
me	-
a	-
lot	-
of	-
time	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
Exactly	-
.	-
Because	-
,	-
yes	-
Spending	-
a	-
lot	-
of	-
time	-
hunting	-
for	-
bikes	-
,	-
and	-
nah	-
well	-
.	-
then	-
getting	-
one	-
purchased	-
,	-
and	-
then	-
having	-
to	-
,	-
you	-
know	-
,	-
go	-
get	-
it	-
and	-
things	-
like	-
that	-
.	-
But	-
,	-
that	-
's	-
dealt	-
with	-
at	-
least	-
.	-
And	-
so	-
%uh	-
,	-
that	-
's	-
yeah	-
at	-
least	-
dealt	-
with	-
.	-
Now	-
I	-
just	-
have	-
to	-
work	-
on	-
the	-
financial	-
aspects	-
of	-
all	-
of	-
this	-
.	-
But	-
yeah	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
At	-
least	-
Well	-
that	-
would	-
make	-
sense	-
during	-
the	-
summer	-
%uh	-
according	-
to	-
the	-
stipulations	-
of	-
my	-
fellowship	-
,	-
I	-
can	-
actually	-
earn	-
money	-
during	-
the	-
summer	-
