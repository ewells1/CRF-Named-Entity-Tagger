if	-
you	-

before	-
that	-
or	-
when	-
it	-
was	-
that	-
was	-
happening	-
.	-
Or	-
I	-
guess	-
not	-
When	-
was	-
it	-
?	-
It	-
may	-
have	-
been	-
right	-
after	-
.	-
Well	-
My	-

,	-
we	-
're	-
getting	-
old	-
.	-
No	-
,	-
it	-
's	-
,	-
I	-
do	-
n't	-
know	-
what	-
it	-
is	-
.	-
It	-
's	-
just	-
,	-
%uh	-
,	-
people	-
get	-
sick	-
,	-
and	-
they	-
get	-
sick	-
pretty	-
young	-
,	-
and	-
,	-
yeah	-
.	-
And	-
you	-
know	-
my	-
sister	-
was	-
n't	-
that	-
old	-
and	-
she	-
just	-
had	-
bad	-
luck	-
I	-
guess	-
is	-
all	-
you	-
can	-
say	-
.	-
yeah	-
.	-
I	-
'm	-
going	-
to	-
put	-
you	-
on	-
after	-
fifteen	-
minutes	-
.	-
I	-
've	-
got	-
to	-
And	-
there	-
was	-
n't	-
anything	(3)
anybody	-
could	-
do	-
.	-
So	-
.	-
And	-
then	-
an	-
aunt	-
of	-
Chris	(4)| (5)
's	-
Aunt	-
Mamie	-
up	-

She	-
passed	-
away	-
in	-
about	-
March	-
or	-
yeah	-
,	-
I	-
think	-
that	-
there	-
was	-
some	-
concern	-
about	-
her	-
when	-
I	-
talked	-
to	-
you	-
in	-
September	-
or	-
October	-
.	-
.	-

she	-
was	-
not	-
doing	-
well	-
.	-
She	-
had	-
a	-
brain	-
tumor	-
.	-
And	-
then	-
they	-
operated	-
on	-
and	-
things	-
were	-
n't	-
going	-
well	-
,	-
and	-
.	-
I	-
actually	-
got	-
to	-
see	-
her	-
I	-
guess	-
a	-
day	-
before	-
she	-
died	-

I	-
mean	-
she	-
did	-
n't	-

a	-
blessing	-
,	-
I	-
guess	-

But	-

very	-
very	-
very	-

just	-
not	-
going	-

have	-
the	-
same	-
kind	-
of	-
career	-
that	-
she	-
had	-
thought	-
about	-

and	-
he	-
was	-
diagnosed	-
