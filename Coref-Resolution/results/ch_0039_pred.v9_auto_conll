You	-

hinted	-
to	-
her	-
that	-
really	-
the	-
only	-
way	-
to	-
lose	-
weight	-
is	-
cardio	-
vascular	-

It	-
's	-
true	-

For	-

is	-
lifting	-
not	-

only	-
thing	-
is	-
%um	-
just	-
getting	-
your	-
heart	-
rate	-
up	-
for	-
extended	-
periods	-
of	-
time	-

So	-

to	-
be	-

's	-

to	-
be	-
debited	-
from	-

after	-
meals	-
yeah	-

and	-
we	-
go	-
through	-
a	-
box	-
of	-
cereal	-
every	-
two	-
days	-
.	-
Really	-
?	-
yeah	-
.	-
Wow	-
.	-
He	-
eats	-
at	-
least	-
like	-
four	-
of	-
cereal	-
a	-
day	-
like	-
in	-
addition	-
to	-
like	-
meals	-
.	-
uh-huh	-
And	-
when	-
he	-
goes	-
to	-

starving	-
when	-
he	-
